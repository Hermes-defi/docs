## **Mission**

The mission is clear and simple.

* Provide all Defi services available on a single platform

## Vision

Defi will be one of the sectors that will be at the forefront of the world economy in the coming years.

Being part of this sector from now on, developing and understanding the mechanisms that manage it and which are the ones that will do it in the future, being ourselves the precursors of them. This allows Hermes to position itself as one of the visible heads of the sector today and as a key player in the future.
