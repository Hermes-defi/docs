# Farming Emissions Schedule

Sixty percent of HERMES (HRMS) will be released over 2.5 years following an optimized emissions schedule. This schedule has been designed to balance APR, circulating HRMS, and the launch of new products built on The Hermes Protocol. **There are NO reward lockup mechanisms from Hermes pools/farms/vaults.**

Higher emissions within the first 3 months of farming will allow us to attract significant liquidity to our platform via high APRs. After this, emissions begin to slow. Every quarter, one month will have a slightly higher emissions than expected in order to provide a small boost for newly released products.

40% (12M HRMS) will be minted upon launch [hermes-token-distribution.md](hermes-token-distribution.md "mention"), but the majority of this HRMS will not become circulating at this time.&#x20;
