# Tokens - IRIS, PLTS, and HRMS

## $IRIS - Governance and Rewards

The IRIS token was launched on September 12th, 2021 and is Hermes DeFi's first token. It has a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens and is fully emitted. It was originally farmable on Polygon, where Hermes DeFi began! Our contracts were audited by [Paladin](https://paladinsec.co/projects/hermes-defi/), and IRIS is now cross-chain (Available on both Polygon and Harmony)! IRIS allows for **governance** over Hermes DeFi through [snapshot voting](https://snapshot.org/#/hermesdefi.eth). This includes things such as pool opening/closings, modifications to emissions or fees, etc.&#x20;

While IRIS acts as our governance token, it is also able to earn rewards through various mechanisms supported by The Hermes Protocol.&#x20;

* 50% of Platform Trading Fees ([#swap-fee](feenomics.md#swap-fee "mention")) will buy IRIS from the market and store it within the Hermes Treasury, reducing effective supply.
* IRIS can be used in farming positions on our new DEX to earn HRMS. Specifically, IRIS holders will be able to farm IRIS / WONE as well as an exclusive single staking IRIS pool.

## $PLTS - Harmony Native Farming Token

The Plutus ($PLTS) token launched on December 27th, 2021 and is Hermes DeFi's second token. It has a total supply of 3,000,000 tokens is now fully emitted! Plutus allowed us to add a new feature on top of the Farms, Vaults, and Pools from our IRIS farming days-- [The Bank](https://hermes-defi.gitbook.io/plutus/products/bank). The Bank allowed us to control the effective supply of PLTS and helped stabilize the price of the token while paying those in the bank DAI (or other partner tokens). This was possible due to a 3% transaction tax on PLTS (2% returned to DAI bank, 1% burned forever).&#x20;

The bank's fantastic success (peaking at over 75% of all PLTS locked) led us to develop sHRMS, which will allow users to earn revenue from protocol volume in a similar way to the 1DAI bank. Stay tuned for more details on this new product.

All PLTS is destined to be converted into HRMS ([plts-to-hrms-transition.md](../the-hermes-protocol/plts-to-hrms-transition.md "mention")), allowing those who farmed PLTS and participated in our Bank system to start farming with HRMS as soon as our DEX launches. All 3,000,000 PLTS (minus burned tokens) will be migrated to HRMS, and will represent 6% of total [HRMS supply](hermes-token-distribution.md). Upon the launch of our DEX, the only way to obtain HRMS is from swapped PLTS or buying it outright.

{% hint style="info" %}
The migration from PLTS to HRMS is **required** due to a 3% transaction tax hard-coded into PLTS.
{% endhint %}

Plutus allowed us to build strong relationships within the Harmony ecosystem by offering rewards to partnering platforms, peaking at \~7.5M TVL during our farming period. It also helped us to receive [a launch grant from Harmony](https://talk.harmony.one/t/hermes-defi-the-hermes-protocol/10339) (50K), which we used to fund further contract audits and pay our developers. Furthermore, it allowed us to raise funds to launch our DEX with deep liquidity, something essential for a successful DEX platform. Finally, the success we demonstrated with $PLTS earned us [a $305,000 investment from the Harmony team](https://talk.harmony.one/t/hermes-defi-investment/12405), propelling us into the main stage of DeFi on Harmony.

{% hint style="info" %}
Acquisition of private funds is the most user-friendly way of funding a protocol. Because of this investment, we do not need to _sell_ HRMS in order to pay our Team, leading to less sell pressure for everyone.
{% endhint %}

Please review the extensive and detailed [plts-to-hrms-transition.md](../the-hermes-protocol/plts-to-hrms-transition.md "mention") documentation to understand this process. If you have questions, don't be afraid to ask on our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/hermesdefi)as part of doing your own research!

## $HRMS - Utility and Ecosystem

Hermes (HRMS) is the main event, what we have all been waiting for! Similar to how SpookySwap has BOO and TraderJoe has JOE, we have HRMS. This token will be the cornerstone of all Hermes products for at least the next 2.5 years. To help users understand how this token can be used, we have compiled a brief description of its uses below:

### What utility does/will the HRMS token have?&#x20;

:green\_heart: - Inflationary (supply increase) mechanism for HRMS

:yellow\_heart: - Neutral mechanism for HRMS

:heart: - Deflationary (supply decrease) mechanism for HRMS

1. :green\_heart: A farming reward token. If you participate in farming, bonding, or other yield-generating mechanisms on The Hermes Protocol, you will earn HRMS for doing so.&#x20;
2. :green\_heart: Earned in lending markets in addition to yields from users borrowing tokens.
3. :green\_heart: Trustless staking of ONE (using hONE, Hermes Staked ONE) and liqudity farming hONE / WONE that rewards HRMS.
4. :yellow\_heart: Ability to be used in borrowing/lending markets as collateral.
5. :heart: HRMS will be used for some (but by no means **all**) of our [hermes-farms.md](../hermes-products/hermes-farms.md "mention"). This means if you want to farm those positions, you will make a HRMS / X LP. This allows for easy one-step swaps between HRMS and any of the paired tokens on our DEX.
6. :heart: Single staking of HRMS (conversion to xHRMS) to earn non-native tokens sourced from partnerships.
7. :heart: Single staking of HRMS (conversion to sHRMS) to earn stablecoins purchased using revenue from trading fees.
8. :heart: Buyback of HRMS from limit order execution (0.22% swap fee vs 0.2%, subject to change).
9. :heart: Beta access to advanced dashboard and analytics features by holding/staking a threshold of HRMS.
10. :heart: \*Used in liquidation-prevention in our money markets features.
11. :heart: \*Buybacks from partnerships surrounding NFT staking.
12. :heart: \*Impermanent loss LP protection mechanism.

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*Some of these concepts are still in the design stage and are subject to change.
{% endhint %}

This does not represent an exhaustive list of the possibilities we are exploring. HRMS will be the foundational token of all Hermes ecosystem products during the 2.5 years it is being emitted. We have dedicated members of our community and team working on making HRMS have tangible uses which separates it from the typical 'farming reward' token.
